# Synology DiskStation Manager

Notes of best practices found around to setup a Synology NAS for home
use. References included at the end. The guide is based on `DSM-7.2`.

## Initial setup

Follow the install instructions after locating the attached NAS on the same
network using [finds.synology.com](http://find.synology.com/).

## Storage manager

### Make volume

You should be greeted with prompt, do as you see wish or flow with the
defaults.

Leave the drive checking, it will take some time.

### Schedule drive tests

`HDD/SSD -> Settings`

- SMART quick test: every month
- SMART extended test: every three months

### Schedule scrubbing

`Storage -> Storage Pool N -> Volume K -> Schedule Data scrubbing`

- enable data scrubbing
- select storage pools
- adjust frequency or choose data scrubbing specific period
- select to run it later, as it is a new install

## Security

### enable security advisor

Will check out the sane and recommended by Synology configurations.

### disable default admin user

Common vector of attack.

### disable ssh

Common vector of attack, notably because only the admin users can use it.

### enable automatic updates for system

### enable automatic updates for services

### change the default ports

`Control Panel -> Login Portal`

### group users into groups

Easier to control policies and permissions and such.

### allow 2 factor authentication

### disable enhancing browser compatibility by skipping IP checking

`Security -> Security` under `General`

### set logout timer

`Security -> Security` under `Login Setitings`

### enable account protection

`Security -> Account` under `Account protection` should be enabled.

### enable adaptive MFA

`Security -> Account` under `Adaptive MFA`

### enable IP level auto blocking

`Security -> Protection` under `Auto Block`

### disable unneeded file services

`File Services -> *` whatever service is not desired

### permission viewer provides one in place overview

`Permission viewer`

### fine tune security advisor profile

### set static IP address

## Users and groups

## Indexing

`Indexing` set the shared folders and type of files to be indexed.

Prefer not to convert by schedule as of time of writing there is no
de-duplication app that will take care and clean up of all lower quality copies.

## Multimedia

### install Multimedia Server package

This allows for low level and quick access to certain folders.

We can enable transcoding server side compressing dense and heavy multimedia.

### install Advanced Media Extensions package

Will allow system run certain compressed techniques.

### Audio and Video Station

Skipping

### install Synology Photos package

`Synology Photos` is searching `/photo` as indexed or `/home/Photos`.

Personal space is at `home` and shared space is the shared folder. It needs be
enabled per user bases or they wont see it using the app.

As of time of writing *unless the options are enabled* the AI won't work:

- Enable the People album in Personal Space
- Enable the subject shared space...

IMPORTANT: as of time of writing Synology is not using external service.

Going trough the faces we can rename the avatars and merge unknown people.

We can download photos from google but without the metadata.

## Control panel

### Fast clone

`File services -> Advanced ` and then select `Fast clone`

### Bypass traverse checking

`File services -> Advanced ` and then select `Enable bypass traverser checking`

## Snapshot replication

Install the service trough `Package manager`.

### Schedule snapshot replication

`Snapshots -> Settings -> Schedule`

- daily at night
- 7 days retention policy

Can make replication.
