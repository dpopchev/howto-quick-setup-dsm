# Synology DiskStation Manager

Configuration rules of thumb for Synology NAS, `DiskStation v7.2`. References included.

## Install

Locate the NAS with [finds.synology.com](http://find.synology.com/) and follow
the instructions; then create a storage pool.

## Storage

### schedule empty all recycle bins task

`Control Panel -> Task Scheduler -> Create`

- run daily
- set retention policy

### schedule SMART HDD tests

`Storage Manager -> HDD/SDD -> Settings -> Task Scheduler`

- SMART quick test every month
- SMART extended test every six months

### schedule pool scrubbing

`Storage Manager -> Storage -> Pool -> Schedule Data Scrubbing`

- every three months
- run it later, if a new install

### have data copies

- ideally schedule backups using `Hyper Backup`
- new HDDs either likely die in first few weeks or then probably last for long time
- it is not uncommon for HDDs in the same series to share same defect and lifespan

### install exFAT access package

- OS-wide supported file system
- suitable to make external HDD and `Hyper Backup` important data

### use Snapshot Replication

`Snapshot replicatoin -> Snapshots`

Configuration per shared folder.

- schedule daily, every 2 hours
- make the snapshots visible

Advanced retain policy:

| last of   | retain period |
|-----------|---------------|
| the hour  | 72 hours      |
| the day   | 7 days        |
| the week  | 4 weeks       |
| the month | 3 months      |

**notes**:
- Number of latest snapshots to keep prevents retention policy deleting all
snapshots when the system stops taking new snapshots.
- think as how far back granularity makes sense, e.g. do you care for hour base
changes of a file that is a moth old, or you care that you have it in that
state overall?
- should be enabled on every newly created shared folder
- retain policies constrain how quickly spaces gained back
- see "DSM Help" for an example

### use Hyper Backup package

Backup either selected folders or packages.

### install Storage Analyzer package

Reports include duplication files.

## Security

### enable auto block

`Control Panel -> Security -> Protection -> Auto Block`

- Log attempts 10
- block for 5 minutes

### enable DoS Protection

`Control Panel -> Security -> Protection -> Auto Block`

### SMB settings

`Control Panel -> File Services -> SMB -> Advanced settings`

- **do not** use SMB1 as there is security vulnerability
- **disable** `NLTMv1`

### disable AFP

`Control Panel -> File Sevices -> AFP`

**disable** as Apple has deprecated it

### disable NFS

`Control Panel -> File Sevices -> NFS`

**disable** as it uses IP, bot user, authentication

### disable FTP

`Control Panel -> File Sevices -> FTP`

**disable** unless needed

### disable default admin user

`Control Panel -> User &  Group`

- **disable** the account named "admin"
- good idea is to generate a random secure password

### disable ssh

`Control Panel -> Terminal & SNMP`

Leave closed unless needed

### enable adaptive MFA

`Control Panel -> Security -> Account`

- **enable** adaptive MFA
- advisable to **enable** 2-factor authentication

### enable account protection

`Control Panel -> Security -> Account -> Account protection`

### disable firewall

`Control Panel -> Security -> Firewall`

Advisable to leave disabled unless more complicated configuration is needed

### enable automatic updates for system

`Control Panel -> Updates & Restore -> DSM Update`

**enable** automatic install of important updates

### enable security advisor

Will check out the sane and recommended by Synology configurations.

### enable automatic updates for services

`Package Manager -> Settings`

**enable** automatic install of important updates

### disable enhancing browser compatibility by skipping IP checking

`Control Panel -> Security -> Security -> General`

### set logout timer

`Control Panel -> Security -> Security -> Login Settings`

### permission viewer provides one in place overview

`Control Panel -> Permission viewer`

## Users and groups

### enable user home service

Creates `homes/` shared folder. Each user will have one folder under it. Each
user will have `home/` shortcut.

### create group

Easier to attach password settings to groups.

### create user

Easier attach to group.

## Indexing

`Indexing` set the shared folders and type of files to be indexed.

Prefer not to convert by schedule as of time of writing there is no
de-duplication app that will take care and clean up of all lower quality copies.

## Multimedia

### install Multimedia Server package

This allows for low level and quick access to certain folders.

We can enable transcoding server side compressing dense and heavy multimedia.

### install Advanced Media Extensions package

Will allow system run certain compressed techniques.

### Audio and Video Station

Skipping. Likely those are in process of deprecation.

### install Synology Photos package

`Synology Photos` is searching `/photo` as indexed and any user `/home/Photos`.

Personal space is at `home` and shared space is the shared folder. It needs be
enabled per user bases or they wont see it using the app.

As of time of writing *unless the options are enabled* the AI won't work:

- Enable the People album in Personal Space
- Enable the subject shared space...

IMPORTANT: as of time of writing Synology is not using external service.

Going trough the faces we can rename the avatars and merge unknown people.

We can download photos from google but without the metadata.

## Shared folders

### enable data checksum

`Control Panel -> Shared Folder -> Create`

- **enable** using the wizard
- it can be checked only on creating the folder

### enable recycle bin

- **enable** using the wizard
- **do not forget** to schedule empty bin task

## General

### enable power recovery

`Control Panel -> Hardware & Power -> General -> Power Recovery`

- restart automatically when power is on

### enable resource usage history

`Resource Monitor -> Settings`

- **enable** usage history

### beep control

`Control Panel -> Hardware & Power -> General -> Beep control`

- know why the NAS beeps
- control whether you want it to beep

### cool fan mode

`Control Panel -> Hardware & Power -> General -> Fan Speed Mode`

- `Cool mode` should be fine

### HDD hibernation

`Control Panel -> Hardware & Power -> HDD hibernation`

- Constant start-stop HDD spinning will shorten the HDD life
- If the NAS is used daily uncheck the advanced hibernation
- Set around 2-3-4 hours;

The gist:
```
root@pop-os:~# mdadm -AsfR && vgchange -ay
mdadm: No arrays found in config file or automatically

lsblk
# md0 is aritrary; sdb5 is the lsblk one holing logical volume
mdadm --assemble --run /dev/md0 /dev/sdb5 --force
# whe busy: mdadm --stop --scan
lvscan
vgchange -ay vg1000 # activiate volume
mount /dev/vg1000/lv /mnt/hd1 -o ro
# when finish
umount /mnt/hd1
vgchange -an vg1000
mdadm --stop /dev/md0
```
