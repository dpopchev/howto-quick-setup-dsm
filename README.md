# Synology DiskStation Manager

Notes howto setup an Synology NAS running `DiskStation` version `7.2`. Find
references at the end.

## Install

Follow the install instructions after locating the attached NAS on the same
network using [finds.synology.com](http://find.synology.com/).

## Storage

### schedule task to empty recycle bin

`Control Panel -> Task Scheduler -> Create`

Rules of thumb:

- empty bins every single night
- setup retention policy of 7 days

### keep copy of old data around

HDD are most likely to die either in the first few weeks and last for very long
time most likely. *resource needed*

### make volume

You should be greeted with prompt, do as you see wish or flow with the
defaults. If missing the wizard use the `Storage manager`.

Leave the drive checking, it will take some time.

### schedule scrubbing pools

- make it every three months
- select to run it later, as it is a new install

### schedule drive tests

- SMART quick test: every month
- SMART extended test: every six months

### install exFAT access package

### install Snapshot replication package

Enable snapshot schedule every 2 hours.

Then set a retention policy:

- keep all snapshots for 5 days
- keep the last snapshot of the day for 30 days

Which means snapshots with granularity of 2 hours for 5 days. After that
snapshot with granularity of a day for the past 30 days.

This means that a delete file won't be lost for 30 days.

Also make snapshots visible to make it easier to find.

**NOTE** Should setup for every new folder

### install Hyper backup package

### prefer SMB connection

Should be work out of box.

SMB2 or higher.

Disable NLTMv1 authentication.

### install Storage Analyzer package

### disable afp

## Security

### enable security advisor

Will check out the sane and recommended by Synology configurations.

### disable default admin user

Common vector of attack.

### disable ssh

Common vector of attack, notably because only the admin users can use it.

### enable automatic updates for system

### enable automatic updates for services

### change the default ports

`Control Panel -> Login Portal`

### group users into groups

Easier to control policies and permissions and such.

### allow 2 factor authentication

### disable enhancing browser compatibility by skipping IP checking

`Security -> Security` under `General`

### set logout timer

`Security -> Security` under `Login Setitings`

### enable account protection

`Security -> Account` under `Account protection` should be enabled.

### enable adaptive MFA

`Security -> Account` under `Adaptive MFA`

### enable IP level auto block

`Security -> Protection` under `Auto Block`

Log attempts 10 and block for 5 minutes is sufficient.

### disable unneeded file services

`File Services -> *` whatever service is not desired

### permission viewer provides one in place overview

`Permission viewer`

### fine tune security advisor profile

### set static IP address

### enable DoS protection

## Users and groups

### enable user home service

### create group

Better to attach password settings to groups.

### create user

Better attach to group.

## Indexing

`Indexing` set the shared folders and type of files to be indexed.

Prefer not to convert by schedule as of time of writing there is no
de-duplication app that will take care and clean up of all lower quality copies.

## Multimedia

### install Multimedia Server package

This allows for low level and quick access to certain folders.

We can enable transcoding server side compressing dense and heavy multimedia.

### install Advanced Media Extensions package

Will allow system run certain compressed techniques.

### Audio and Video Station

Skipping

### install Synology Photos package

`Synology Photos` is searching `/photo` as indexed or `/home/Photos`.

Personal space is at `home` and shared space is the shared folder. It needs be
enabled per user bases or they wont see it using the app.

As of time of writing *unless the options are enabled* the AI won't work:

- Enable the People album in Personal Space
- Enable the subject shared space...

IMPORTANT: as of time of writing Synology is not using external service.

Going trough the faces we can rename the avatars and merge unknown people.

We can download photos from google but without the metadata.

## Shared folders

### enable datachecksum for advanced technology

Do for *every* shared folder.

### enable recycle bin

But do not forget to schedule the empting of those.

## Hardware and Power

### enable restart automatically when power is on

### check out beep control

### cool fan mode

### set 3 hours hdd hibernation

## HDD recovery

The gist:
```
root@pop-os:~# mdadm -AsfR && vgchange -ay
mdadm: No arrays found in config file or automatically

lsblk
# md0 is aritrary; sdb5 is the lsblk one holing logical volume
mdadm --assemble --run /dev/md0 /dev/sdb5 --force
# whe busy: mdadm --stop --scan
lvscan
vgchange -ay vg1000 # activiate volume
